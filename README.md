# OKBoomer
A dating app for 'Boomers' (geared towards those over the age of 45, but not restricted). We have noticed that despite their being a significant portion of the population single and over 45, there are few dating apps geared towards that age group. Similarly, of those that have used those applications or sites, quite a few have had bad experiences. Therefore, we wanted to create OKBoomer, an application focused on efficiency, efficacy, utility, and the safetly of their users.

## Implementation
We will be creating the app in Android Studio and storing the data within a SQL database.
